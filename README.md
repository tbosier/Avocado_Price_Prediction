# Avocado Price Optimization Project

In this project, I will predict the demand of avocados based on a number of variable and then pass this demand and price into an optimization algorithm to arrive at the optimum price. 

## Data

This data is from Kaggle, specifically: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/timmate/avocado-prices-2020?resource=download

## Method

We will first analyze our data to get a sense of what's in front of us. We will need to preprocess the data so as to get our specific regions.

### Model

We will try a few models but we should concern ourselves with the correct model, so as to avoid any leakage.
